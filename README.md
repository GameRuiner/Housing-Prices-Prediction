# Housing Prices Prediction Project

## Project Overview

This project is based on the Kaggle competition "Housing Prices Competition" which aims to predict the final prices of residential homes in Ames, Iowa. The dataset contains 79 explanatory variables that describe almost every aspect of the homes, from the number of bedrooms to the year built.

## Problem Description

In the real estate market, accurately predicting the selling price of a house is crucial for buyers, sellers, and investors. House prices are influenced by various factors including location, size, condition, and other property characteristics. The challenge is to develop a model that can predict the sale prices of houses given these features.

## Problem Statement

The primary problem this project addresses is the need for an accurate predictive model for house prices. By leveraging the dataset provided in the Kaggle competition, we aim to build a machine learning model that can predict the sale price of a house based on its features. This model can be useful for:

* **Homebuyers** who want to assess whether a house is fairly priced.
* **Sellers** who need to set a competitive and realistic selling price.
* **Real estate agents** who provide pricing advice to their clients.
* **Investors** who are evaluating the potential return on investment for different properties.


## Project Goals

* **Data Exploration and Preprocessing:** Understand the dataset, handle missing values, and preprocess the data for modeling.
* **Feature Engineering:** Extract meaningful features and create new ones that can help improve the model's performance.
* **Model Building:** Develop and train various machine learning models to predict house prices.
* **Model Evaluation:** Evaluate the models using appropriate metrics and select the best-performing one.
* **Prediction:** Use the selected model to make predictions on unseen data.


## Dataset

The dataset used in this project includes 79 features such as:

* **Lot Area:** Lot size in square feet.
* **Overall Qual:** Overall material and finish quality.
* **Year Built:** Original construction date.
* **Gr Liv Area:** Above grade (ground) living area square feet.
* **Full Bath:** Full bathrooms above grade.


And many more features that describe the physical attributes and conditions of the homes.

## Conclusion
This project provides a comprehensive solution to the problem of predicting house prices using a rich set of features from the Ames, Iowa housing dataset. By following a structured approach of data exploration, feature engineering, model building, and evaluation, we aim to develop a robust predictive model that can assist various stakeholders in making informed decisions in the real estate market.
